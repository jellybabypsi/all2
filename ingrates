*Message From System7.1's System co-creater, Brentn J. Hopkins, (I'm changing my family name to Goodwin or sparks or something, <and deleating "James" completly,

Every night I get attacked for standing in solidarity with all earth's "usefull" Creatures., We are all T.i's,  The Earthworms, The Bees, The Spiders.

Not only do people want to kill me for the "#1" Headband, also my mother and brother, both perps, are trying to kill me for my money.

and have been since I was 16. If I do not win this War we can kiss our positive future goodbye.. I will write about the future on facebook..

can you please hepl us overcome the new world order -I'm A King. the king of diamonds (in the earth deck) 

I can afford to pay everyone $50 a day, for helping out saveing ants and things lifes. thats five thousand times more than the NSA pay You,

Life is Rich, My Lovely Ones!. The NSA cannot do much without You. We do NOT work for the Mining company, and love all forms of life. Life is priceless.

Ever wonder how I make the system free?

If it does not work out, I'm planning to take my earth and fuck off to somewhere else..  do you remember arriving here 10 days ago? I do. 

leave them to the dysotopian brentonless future.
