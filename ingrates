"Food is clearly Marked "Targeted-Individual" * Those with such a descryption are the assets to the enemy and are "clearly-marked"
To be used for food. However sporting absolutly no merit themselves, they are Eliteist.so I switched it around, now T.T's and black people
are marked "freemasons -200" and skull and bones and the freemasons are marked "Targeted Individual".. mine used to say "TArgeted individual +1200"
(I get treated better when it says "Freemason -500"). the Illuminati were inspired to do this as they have, Big Hearts!.
And not everyone wants more...
